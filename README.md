## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS

### What I learned

One of the most major learnings from this project is the carousel component with a thumbmail navigation, and the lightbox which is basicly just the carousel but with a modifier class turning it to a lightbox. To save carousel functionality after cloning one for lightbox implementation, it was decided to make a special carousel class. (See files for more detail)

### Continued development

The carousel is currently responsive, but does not have full accesability. The user cart also needs work. I just thought that my goal in this project has been achieved so far. I'm also not entirely happy with the carousel class. I feel like I could have accomplished the same thing in a more efficient way.

### Useful resources
